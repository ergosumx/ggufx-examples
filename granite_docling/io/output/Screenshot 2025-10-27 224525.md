<text><loc_88><loc_180><loc_405><loc_208>To the best of our knowledge there is no paired dataset of PDF pages and corresponding source code out there, so we created our own from the open access articles on arXiv. 4 For layout diversity we also include a subset of the PubMed Central 5 (PMC) open access non-commercial dataset. During the pretraining, a portion of the Industry Documents Library 6 (IDL) is included. See Table A.1 for the dataset composition.</text>
<text><loc_88><loc_213><loc_405><loc_248>arXiv We collected the source code and compiled PDFs from 1,748,201 articles released on arXiv. To ensure consistent formatting, we first process the source files using LaTeX 7 and convert them into HTML5 files. This step was important as it standardized and removed ambiguity from the LaTeX source code, especially in mathematical expressions. The conversion process included replacing user-defined macros, standardizing whitespace, adding optional brackets, normalizing tables, and replacing references and citations with their correct numbers.</text>
<text><loc_88><loc_254><loc_405><loc_275>We then parse the HTML files and convert them into a lightweight markup language that supports various elements such as headings, bold and italic text, algorithms, LaTeX inline and display math and LaTeX tables. This way, we ensure that the source code is properly formatted and ready for further processing.</text>
<text><loc_88><loc_277><loc_177><loc_283>The process is visualized in Fig. 3.</text>
<text><loc_88><loc_288><loc_405><loc_323>PMC We also processed articles from PMC, where XML files with semantic information are available in addition to the PDF file. We parse these files into the same markup language format as the arXiv articles. We chose to use far fewer articles from PMC because the XML files are not always as rich in semantic information. Often times equations and tables are stored as images and these cases are not trivial to detect, which leads to our decision to limit the use of PMC articles to the pre-training phase.</text>
<text><loc_88><loc_328><loc_297><loc_334>The XML files are parsed into the same markup language as described above.</text>
<text><loc_88><loc_339><loc_405><loc_367>IDL The IDL is a collection of documents produced by industries that have an impact on public health and is maintained by the University of California, San Francisco Library. Biten et al. [37] provide high quality OCR text for PDFs from the IDL dataset. This does not include text formatting and is only used for pre-training to teach the model basic OCR of scanned documents.</text>
<section_header_level_1><loc_88><loc_384><loc_157><loc_390>4.1 Splitting the pages</section_header_level_1>
<text><loc_88><loc_398><loc_405><loc_432>We split the markdown files according to the page breaks in the PDF file and rasterize each page as an image to create the final paired dataset. During the compilation, the LaTeX compiler determines the page breaks of the PDF file automatically. Since we are not recompiling the LaTeX sources for each paper, we must heuristically split the source file into parts, which correspond to different pages. To achieve that we are using the embedded text on the PDF page and match it to source text.</text>
<text><loc_88><loc_434><loc_405><loc_440>However, figures and tables in the PDF may not correspond to their position in the source code. To address this issue,</text>
